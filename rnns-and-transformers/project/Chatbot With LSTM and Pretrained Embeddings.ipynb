    "In this project, you will build a chatbot that can converse with you at the command line. The chatbot will use a Sequence to Sequence text generation architecture with an LSTM as it's memory unit. You will also learn to use pretrained word embeddings to improve the performance of the model. At the conclusion of the project, you will be able to show your chatbot to potential employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have the option to use pretrained word embeddings in your model. We have loaded Brown Embeddings from Gensim in the starter code below. You can compare the performance of your model with pre-trained embeddings against a model without the embeddings.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build your Vocabulary & create the Word Embeddings\n",
    "# The most important part of this step is to create your Vocabulary object using a corpus of data drawn from TorchText.\n",

    "# (Extra Credit)\n",
    "# Use Gensim to extract the word embeddings from one of its corpus'.\n",
    "# Use NLTK and Gensim to create a function to clean your text and look up the index of a word's embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create the Encoder\n",
    "# A Seq2Seq architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder unit. You will use Pytorch to build a full Seq2Seq model.\n",
    "# The first step of the architecture is to create an encoder with an LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (Extra Credit)\n",
    "# Load your pretrained embeddings into the LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Create the Decoder\n",
    "# The second step of the architecture is to create a decoder using a second LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Combine them into a Seq2Seq Architecture\n",
    "# To finalize your model, you will combine the encoder and decoder units into a working model.\n",
    "# The Seq2Seq2 model must be able to instantiate the encoder and decoder. Then, it will accept the inputs for these units and manage their interaction to get an output using the forward pass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Train & evaluate your model\n",
    "# Finally you will train and evaluate your model using a Pytorch training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6: Interact with the Chatbot\n",

      "What entity provides help with the management of time for new students at Notre Dame? All of Notre Dame's undergraduate students are a part of one of the five undergraduate colleges at the school or are in the First Year of Studies program. The First Year of Studies program was established in 1962 to guide incoming freshmen in their first year at the school before they have declared a major. Each student is given an academic advisor from the program who helps them to choose classes that give them exposure to any major in which they are interested. The program also includes a Learning Resource Center which provides time management, collaborative learning, and subject tutoring. This program has been recognized previously, by U.S. News & World Report, as outstanding.\n",
