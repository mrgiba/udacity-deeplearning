    "In this project, you will build a chatbot that can converse with you at the command line. The chatbot will use a Sequence to Sequence text generation architecture with an LSTM as it's memory unit. You will also learn to use pretrained word embeddings to improve the performance of the model. At the conclusion of the project, you will be able to show your chatbot to potential employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have the option to use pretrained word embeddings in your model. We have loaded Brown Embeddings from Gensim in the starter code below. You can compare the performance of your model with pre-trained embeddings against a model without the embeddings.\n",

    "# Instructions Summary\n",
    "# The LSTM Chatbot will help you show off your skills as a deep learning practitioner. You will develop the chatbot using a new architecture called a Seq2Seq. \n",
    "# Additionally, you can use pre-trained word embeddings to improve the performance of your model. Let's get started by following the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build your Vocabulary & create the Word Embeddings\n",
    "# The most important part of this step is to create your Vocabulary object using a corpus of data drawn from TorchText.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (Extra Credit)\n",
    "# Use Gensim to extract the word embeddings from one of its corpus'.\n",
    "# Use NLTK and Gensim to create a function to clean your text and look up the index of a word's embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Create the Encoder\n",
    "# A Seq2Seq architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder unit. You will use Pytorch to build a full Seq2Seq model.\n",
    "# The first step of the architecture is to create an encoder with an LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (Extra Credit)\n",
    "# Load your pretrained embeddings into the LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Create the Decoder\n",
    "# The second step of the architecture is to create a decoder using a second LSTM unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Combine them into a Seq2Seq Architecture\n",
    "# To finalize your model, you will combine the encoder and decoder units into a working model.\n",
    "# The Seq2Seq2 model must be able to instantiate the encoder and decoder. Then, it will accept the inputs for these units and manage their interaction to get an output using the forward pass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Train & evaluate your model\n",
    "# Finally you will train and evaluate your model using a Pytorch training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6: Interact with the Chatbot\n",
    "# Demonstrate your chatbot by converting the outputs of the model to text and displaying it's responses at the command line."

      "Where can a temple of the Jain faith be found? Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct. Jainism is practiced by a small community. A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar, where Jains practice their faith. According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Nepal, there are approximately 300 Baha'is in Kathmandu valley. They have a National Office located in Shantinagar, Baneshwor. The Baha'is also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu. Islam is practised in Kathmandu but Muslims are a minority, accounting for about 4.2% of the population of Nepal.[citation needed] It is said that in Kathmandu alone there are 170 Christian churches. Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools are also operating. Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies, who had converted to Christianity while in service, on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion. They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu, in particular.\n",
